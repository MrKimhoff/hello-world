# hello-world
Simple repository from the GitHub startup guide
My name is Taylor and I am working on my Master's in Data Science at Bellevue University
I love gaming and lifting weights. Right now my main game is Destiny 2, though I am looking forward to the 2021 holiday releases
I have a cat named Kahlua and he is the best!
I am hoping to put my coding skills to the use by helping people in some capacity.
